# Install UiPath permission allowlist

Help the user add a curated allowlist of safe `uip` subcommands to their Claude Code settings so the agent is not prompted on every command.

**Why this command exists.** Claude Code plugins cannot ship permission rules declaratively — per the [plugins docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins.md#ship-default-settings-with-your-plugin), only the `agent` and `subagentStatusLine` keys are honored in a plugin-shipped `settings.json`; any `permissions` block is silently ignored. Without a user-configured allowlist, every `Bash(...)` invocation prompts for approval, and a realistic Flow or RPA build runs 25+ distinct `uip` subcommands.

## Steps

1. **Ask which variant to install** using `AskUserQuestion`:
   - **Full — with safety rails** (default, recommended) — writes both `allow` and `ask`. Cloud-side-effect commands (`debug` / `upload` / `publish` / `pack` / `login`) still prompt, even under `defaultMode: bypassPermissions` or `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Prevents accidental prod publishes in YOLO mode.
   - **Allow-only — no safety rails** — writes only the `allow` block. Power users who explicitly want zero prompts under `--dangerously-skip-permissions` pick this. Accept that a stray `uip solution publish` will execute without confirmation.

2. **Ask where to install the allowlist** using a second `AskUserQuestion`:
   - **Project — `.claude/settings.local.json`** (default) — applies only to the current project; conventionally not committed to git.
   - **Project — `.claude/settings.json`** — applies only to the current project; usually committed.
   - **Global — `~/.claude/settings.json`** — applies to every project.
   - **Just print it** — output the JSON only, do not write anything.
   - **Something else** — accept a custom path string.

3. **Read the target file.** If it exists, parse the JSON strictly. If it already contains `permissions.allow` or `permissions.ask`, preserve existing entries and add only the missing ones (deduplicate by exact string). If there is no `permissions` block, add one. If the file parses as invalid JSON, abort with a clear message and ask the user to fix it manually — do not attempt to rewrite.

   - If the user chose **allow-only** in step 1 and the target file already has relevant `ask` entries from a prior run, **do not remove them** — leave existing `ask` rules intact. Only the `write` side is skipped; pre-existing safety rails the user already opted into stay put.

4. **Show the proposed diff** — print the delta (new entries being added to `allow`, and to `ask` if included) before writing. Do not print the full file.

5. **Ask for explicit confirmation** to write. Do not write without a yes.

6. **Write the file** with the merged JSON. Preserve existing formatting (indentation, key order) as much as reasonably possible.

7. **Report** the path written, which variant was installed (full vs allow-only), and tell the user the new rules take effect on the next tool call — no restart required.

## Recommended allowlist

Split by risk. `allow` = read-only or local-only commands; `ask` = commands with cloud or filesystem side effects (keep the prompt even if a future `defaultMode` tries to auto-allow).

```jsonc
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      // binary + auth status (read-only)
      "Bash(uip --version)",
      "Bash(uip login status)",
      "Bash(uip login status *)",
      "Bash(which uip)",

      // discovery — registry + Integration Service + Orchestrator list ops (all read-only)
      "Bash(uip flow registry *)",
      "Bash(uip is *)",               // Integration Service (connections, connectors, resources, triggers)
      "Bash(uip or folders *)",       // Orchestrator folders

      // local-only flow / solution / agent scaffolding
      "Bash(uip flow init *)",
      "Bash(uip flow validate *)",

      "Bash(uip rpa *)",

      // uipath-troubleshoot — read-only diagnostics. Scoped PER VERB on purpose:
      // a bare `uip or jobs *` would also allow stop/start/restart/resume;
      // `uip resource *` would allow delete/upload/add; `uip maestro bpmn instance *`
      // would allow cancel/retry/goto/variables-set. Mutating verbs are left out so
      // they keep prompting (fails closed — a new CLI verb is never auto-allowed).

      "Bash(uip maestro bpmn instance element-executions *)",

      // uipath-troubleshoot — investigation workspace (local, throwaway) + bundled playbooks.
      // Write/Edit prompt by default; the Read rules are insurance (file reads are not gated
      // by Claude Code, but they document intent and survive stricter permission modes).
      "Read(.local/investigations/**)",
      "Write(.local/investigations/**)",
      "Edit(.local/investigations/**)",
      "Read(//**/uipath-troubleshoot/references/**)"
    ],
    "ask": [
      "Bash(uip login)",
      "Bash(uip login --authority *)",
      "Bash(uip flow debug)",
      "Bash(uip flow debug *)",

    ]
  }
}

## Notes

- Pattern syntax is literal-prefix + `*` wildcard with a space before `*` — see the [Claude Code settings docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings.md#permissions-configuration).
- `Bash(uip login status *)` matches `uip login status --output json`; `Bash(uip login)` (exact, no wildcard) matches only the bare interactive login so it keeps its prompt.
- Rule precedence in Claude Code is `deny > ask > allow`, and rules are evaluated **before** `defaultMode` / `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. So the `ask` list in the full variant still forces a prompt under YOLO mode — that is the point of it, and it is the difference between the two variants offered in step 1.
- If the user has existing `permissions.deny` rules mentioning `uip`, do not remove them — respect explicit denials even if they conflict with the recommended allowlist. Surface the conflict in chat and ask.
- Never modify `~/.claude/settings.json` without explicit consent — that file often contains secrets (tokens, env vars) and should not be edited casually. If the user picks the global option, re-confirm before writing.
- The full variant's `ask` block intentionally guards `uip solution upload`, `uip flow debug`, `uip flow pack`, `uip solution publish`, and `uip login` — these produce real cloud side effects (publishing, executing flows, tenant auth). The `uipath-maestro-flow` skill's rules explicitly require user consent before cloud-executing a flow.
- `uip agent init` is in `allow` (scaffolding — same as `uip flow init`). It does not publish to the cloud; it creates local agent project files.
- `uip rpa *` covers the full RPA subcommand tree (`build`, `get-errors`, `create-project`, `find-activities`, `inspect-package`, `focus-activity`, etc.). None of these publish to the cloud — RPA deployment flows through `uip solution upload` / `publish` (already guarded in `ask`).
- The `uipath-troubleshoot` skill is read-only — it inspects jobs, assets, queue-items, traces, and Maestro instances but never mutates them. Its verbs are allowlisted **per read verb** (e.g. `uip or jobs get *`, not `uip or jobs *`) so mutating siblings keep prompting: `or jobs stop/start/restart/resume`, `or assets create/delete/update/share`, `or licenses toggle`, `resource … delete/upload/add/update`, and `maestro bpmn instance cancel/retry/goto/pause/resume/migrate/message send/variables-set`. This fails closed — a newly shipped CLI verb is never auto-allowed.
- The troubleshoot rules cover the canonical short form `uip or …`. If the agent uses the long-form alias `uip orchestrator …`, it will still prompt; the fix is to keep the skill on the short form, not to widen the allowlist.
- `Read/Write/Edit(.local/investigations/**)` cover the throwaway investigation workspace the troubleshoot sub-agents write to (`state.json`, `hypotheses.json`, `evidence/`, `raw/`, `depth-check.json`, etc.). Without the `Write`/`Edit` rules every investigation step prompts.
- `Read(//**/uipath-troubleshoot/references/**)` matches the skill's bundled playbooks wherever the plugin is installed (`//` anchors to the filesystem root; `**/` matches arbitrary intermediate dirs). Per the Claude Code docs, file reads are never gated, so this rule is insurance rather than load-bearing.
