# case (root) — Planning

The root case definition — the top-level container that every other node lives inside. Created exactly once per project. Under the JSON strategy the case plugin **also owns project scaffolding** (the 5 boilerplate files written by `uip maestro case init` on the CLI path) — see [impl-json.md](impl-json.md).

## When to Use

Always. This plugin is invoked for the very first T-entry (`T01`) in every `tasks.md`. It creates the case file and the implicit Trigger node.

## Required Fields from sdd.md

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `name` | sdd.md case title | Human-readable. |
| `file` | Derived: `<SolutionDir>/<ProjectName>/caseplan.json` | **Literal filename `caseplan.json`** — do not substitute project name. |
| `case-identifier` | sdd.md (optional; defaults to `name`) | The runtime identifier. |
| `identifier-type` | sdd.md (optional; default `constant`) | `constant` \| `external`. Use `external` when sdd.md says the identifier comes from an upstream system. |
| `case-app-enabled` | sdd.md (default `false`) | `true` if the sdd.md says the case is exposed via the Case App UI. |
| `description` | sdd.md case description |  |

## identifier-type Guidance

- `constant` — **Default.** Use when sdd.md does not mention external identifier sources. The case identifier is fixed across instances (typically matches `name`).
- `external` — Use when sdd.md says something like "the case is identified by the incoming PO number" or "the case uses the external ticket ID." Runtime will pull the identifier from case data.

When ambiguous, use **AskUserQuestion** with both options + "Something else".

## Registry Resolution

**None.** The root case has no registry representation — no `taskTypeId`, no enrichment.

## Trigger Node — Emitted by Triggers Plugin (T02)

The case plugin writes a pure skeleton at T01 — no trigger node. The primary trigger is added by the triggers plugin at T02 via the matching [triggers plugin](../triggers/). Every case (single-trigger or multi-trigger) has at least one T02 entry for the primary trigger.

## tasks.md Entry Format

```markdown
## T01: Create case file "<name>"
- file: "<SolutionDir>/<ProjectName>/caseplan.json"
- case-identifier: "<identifier>"
- identifier-type: constant
- case-app-enabled: false
- description: "<one-sentence description>"
- order: first
- verify: Confirm caseplan.json written and parses; root.id == "root", nodes == [], edges == []
```

## Project Structure Prerequisites

The case file lives inside a solution + project structure. After T01 completes, the layout is:

```
<directory>/
  <SolutionName>/
    <SolutionName>.uipx            ← created by `uip solution init` (Step 6.0, CLI)
    <ProjectName>/                 ← created + populated by T01 (case plugin)
      project.uiproj               ← § Scaffold writes
      operate.json                 ← § Scaffold writes
      entry-points.json            ← § Scaffold writes (empty entryPoints[])
      bindings_v2.json             ← § Scaffold writes
      package-descriptor.json      ← § Scaffold writes
      caseplan.json                ← § Write caseplan.json writes
```

Planning-phase contract: T01 emits all 5 scaffold files + `caseplan.json` inside `<SolutionDir>/<ProjectName>/`. CLI `uip solution init` and `uip solution project add` bookend T01 as Step 6.0 and Step 6.0b.
