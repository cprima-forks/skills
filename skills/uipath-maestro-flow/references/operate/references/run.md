# Run — Execute a Flow

Execute a flow on demand and monitor progress. Three modes: **debug** (controlled re-run with full Studio Web visibility), **process run** (trigger a deployed process), **job inspection** (status and traces). All require `uip login`.

## Pre-flight

1. **Logged in.** `uip login status --output json` returns success. See [shared/cli-conventions.md — Login state](../../shared/cli-conventions.md#4-login-state).
2. **For debug runs: solution resources refreshed.** Always run before `flow debug` so connection and process resource declarations are in sync with project bindings:

   ```bash
   uip solution resource refresh <SolutionDir> --output json
   ```

## Debug — controlled end-to-end run

> **Confirm consent first.** `flow debug` executes the flow for real — sends emails, posts messages, calls APIs. See the consent-before-debug rule in [SKILL.md](../../../SKILL.md). Do not run without explicit user authorization.

```bash
UIPCLI_LOG_LEVEL=info uip maestro flow debug <path-to-project-dir> --output json
```

The argument is the **project directory path** (the folder containing `project.uiproj`). Use `<ProjectName>/` from the solution dir, or `.` if already inside the project dir.

Pass input arguments when the flow has input parameters:

```bash
UIPCLI_LOG_LEVEL=info uip maestro flow debug <path-to-project-dir> --output json \
  --inputs '{"numberA": 5, "numberB": 7}'
```

### Reporting debug runs to the user

The CLI response includes a **Studio Web URL** (where the user inspects the run) and an **instanceId** (for log/trace correlation). Parse both from the JSON output — typically `Data.studioWebUrl` and `Data.instanceId` — and **always show them as the first two lines of the summary**:

```text
Studio Web URL: <url>
Instance ID: <instanceId>

<run status, node traces, errors, etc.>
```

If either value is missing from the response, emit the label with `<not returned by CLI>` rather than dropping the line. Do not bury these values below the run summary — the user should see them immediately without scrolling.

See [shared/cli-commands.md — uip maestro flow debug](../../shared/cli-commands.md#uip-maestro-flow-debug) for additional options.

## Process run — trigger a deployed process

For flows already deployed to Orchestrator (via [ship.md](ship.md) → Orchestrator path):

```bash
uip maestro flow process list --output json                           # discover deployed processes
uip maestro flow process run <process-key> <folder-key> --output json # trigger a run
```

Run `uip maestro flow process --help` for all subcommands and options.

## Job inspection — status and traces

```bash
uip maestro flow job status <job-key> --output json   # check status of a running or completed job
uip maestro flow job traces <job-key> --output json   # stream the verbose execution timeline
```

> **Traces are verbose** and contain the full execution timeline. Use them only when needed for diagnosis — start from incidents first via [diagnose/CAPABILITY.md](../../diagnose/CAPABILITY.md).

## What's next

- **Run failed?** Triage via [diagnose/CAPABILITY.md](../../diagnose/CAPABILITY.md) — start with incidents, escalate to traces only if needed.
- **Need to intervene in a running instance** (pause, resume, cancel, retry)? See [manage.md](manage.md).

## Anti-patterns

- **Never run `flow debug` as a validation step.** Use `uip maestro flow validate` for correctness checking; debug is for end-to-end execution.
- **Never skip `solution resource refresh` before debug.** Stale resource declarations cause runtime binding failures even when the local `.flow` is correct.
- **Never start diagnosis from `job traces`.** Traces are last-resort — see [diagnose/CAPABILITY.md](../../diagnose/CAPABILITY.md) for the priority ladder.
