# Releasing the skills package

The whole skills repo is published as an npm package, **`@uipath/skills`**, versioned in lockstep with **`@uipath/cli`** so a given CLI release always resolves to a compatible skills package.

## Version model

`package.json` `version` is the **single source of truth** for the npm package. `scripts/sync-version.mjs` derives this manifest from it (do not edit by hand):

| File | Field | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `version-manifest.json` | `skillsVersion`, `targetCli` | CLI↔skills pairing record |

> **Not yet unified:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` stay on their own version track (bumped daily by `daily-version-bump.yml`) until the alignment task lands. Unifying them under this scheme is tracked separately — see the linked Jira task in PR #1283.

Run after any version change:

```bash
npm run version:sync      # rewrite derived manifests from package.json
npm run version:check     # CI guard — non-zero exit if drifted
```

### Why lockstep with the CLI

The version line mirrors the CLI's `MAJOR.MINOR` (e.g. CLI `1.196.x` → skills `1.196.x`). `version-manifest.json.targetCli` records the matching line as `^MAJOR.MINOR.0`. The CLI pins this line, so it never pulls a skills package from a different minor.

> **Today the CLI clones `main` directly** (`packages/cli/src/commands/skills/contentStore.ts` → `REPO_URL` / `ZIP_URL`). That is the mismatch source: any CLI version gets whatever is on `main` at install time. Switching that consumption path to install the pinned `@uipath/skills` version is the **CLI-side change** that closes the loop — tracked as a decision below, not yet done.

## Publishing tracks (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)

| Trigger | Registry | dist-tag | Version |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| `workflow_dispatch` (target: `github-alpha`) | GitHub Packages | `alpha` | `<base>-alpha.<YYYYMMDD>.<run_number>` |
| GitHub Release published | npmjs | `latest` | `package.json` version |
| `workflow_dispatch` (target: `npmjs`) | npmjs | `latest` | `package.json` version |

Both tracks are **manually triggered** — there is no auto-publish on push to `main`. Alpha is dispatched on demand; stable runs when a GitHub Release is published. `npm install @uipath/skills` (no tag) always resolves to the last stable npmjs release — alphas live only under the `alpha` tag on GitHub Packages.

### Registry routing

`@uipath/skills` is a **scoped** package, so each publish job sets the target registry through the **scoped registry** that `actions/setup-node` writes (`@uipath:registry=<url>` + auth) — not a `--registry` flag (which only sets the *unscoped* default and is ignored for scoped packages). For the same reason there is **no committed `.npmrc` and no `publishConfig.registry`**: a static scoped-registry line would override the per-job target (and would break `npm install` for anyone cloning this public repo).

| Job | `registry-url` (setup-node) | Result |
|-----|------------------------------|--------|
| `publish-alpha` | `https://npm.pkg.github.com` | publishes to GitHub Packages |
| `publish-release` | `https://registry.npmjs.org` | publishes to npmjs |

## Cutting a stable release

1. Bump `package.json` to the target version (match the CLI minor line), run `npm run version:sync`, merge.
2. Create a GitHub Release tagged `v<version>` → `publish.yml` publishes to npmjs.

## Required secrets / setup (TODO before first publish)

- [ ] **`NPM_TOKEN`** — npmjs **granular** automation token scoped to **`@uipath/skills` only** (least privilege — not the whole `@uipath` org). For stable releases.
- [ ] Confirm the npm package name/scope: **`@uipath/skills`** (assumed).
- [x] Seed version confirmed: **`1.196.0`** (current CLI minor line). Automating the ongoing CLI↔skills lockstep is tracked in PILOT-5518.

> The alpha track needs no secret — `publish-alpha` uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write`.
