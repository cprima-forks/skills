# Maestro BPMN Skill Eval Tasks

These tasks exercise the `uipath-maestro-bpmn` skill and its public-safe validation fixture corpus.

The layout mirrors the Flow eval suite:

- `smoke/` covers lifecycle and fixture smoke checks.
- `author/` covers BPMN skeleton structure, gateways, sequence flows, and diagrams.
- `nodes/` covers task wrapper and script-task authoring behavior.
- `nodes/contract_variant_wrappers.yaml` covers public-safe Maestro BPMN XML
  contract variants from imported-wrapper parsing, including async call
  activities, message events, case-management shells, preserve-only payloads,
  and numeric migration metadata.
- `skills/uipath-maestro-bpmn/fixtures/validation/registry-coverage-matrix/`
  keeps the static fixture corpus aligned with the current registry wrapper
  surface without claiming cloud execution of resource-backed tasks.
- `connector/` covers Integration Service boundary behavior without cloud-side mutations.
- `_shared/` contains small Python helpers for durable XML shape assertions.

## Contributor Commands

From the repository root:

```bash
bash skills/uipath-maestro-bpmn/.maintenance/check-validation-fixtures.sh
bash skills/uipath-maestro-bpmn/.maintenance/check-all.sh
```

Run the Maestro BPMN smoke eval:

```bash
cd tests
make tags TAGS="uipath-maestro-bpmn smoke" EXPERIMENT=experiments/default.yaml
```

Run all tests for this skill:

```bash
cd tests
make test-uipath-maestro-bpmn
```

CI should run the two maintenance commands before evals so malformed fixture or documentation drift fails before an agent run starts.
